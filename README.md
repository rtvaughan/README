Part 1 FunWithIntArrayTester
    We were given some code for that tests a program. We learned how to identify
 errors in the code so that the code returns the proper values as it tests the program

Part 2 Part2Tester
   We had to find errors in code that we could only see a description for, and 
   we had to create test that would expose the errors in the code.

Part 3 Caesar
   We had to create an encryption that would change only the alphabetical letters
   and leaves the non-alphabetical characters alone. We had to use three differnt
 ways of changing the characters to the same result.
